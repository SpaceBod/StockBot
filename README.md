# StockBot
A Discord bot built with JAVA, that scrapes data from store websites, alerting you the instant an item of interest becomes available.

## Purpose
The scarse availability of GPUs is down to the global chip shortage and the increased population of crypto miners.
It has become seemingly impossible to acquire a GPU at a sensible price (MSRP), due to crypto miners and scalpers buying up stock.
Therefore, I devloped a program that would alert real buyers the moment a GPU comes in stock.

Currently setup for NVIDIAs & AMDs GPU store pages.
